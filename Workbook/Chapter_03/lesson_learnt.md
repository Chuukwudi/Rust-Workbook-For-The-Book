Summary of What Was Learned in This Chapter
Key Topics Covered

    Variables and Mutability
        Variables are immutable by default.
        Use mut to make variables mutable.
        Constants are always immutable and require type annotations.
        Variables can be shadowed, allowing for transformations or type changes.

    Data Types
        Scalar Types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
        Compound Types: tuples and arrays.
        Type annotations are required in certain situations to help the compiler.
        Arrays and tuples have fixed lengths and can be destructured for individual values.

    Functions
        Declared using the fn keyword.
        Parameters and return types must be explicitly typed.
        Functions return the value of their final expression unless a return statement is used.

    Statements and Expressions
        Statements perform actions but donâ€™t return values.
        Expressions evaluate to a value and are used within statements.

    Comments
        Single-line comments use //.
        Multi-line comments repeat // for each line.
        Comments are ignored by the compiler but help document the code.

    Control Flow
        If Expressions: Used for branching logic. Conditions must evaluate to bool.
        Loops: Includes loop, while, and for.
            loop: Runs indefinitely unless break or return is used.
            while: Runs while a condition is true.
            for: Iterates over a collection or range.
