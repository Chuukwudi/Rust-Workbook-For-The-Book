# Workbook Exercises

---

## 1. Variables and Mutability

- Create a variable `x` with an initial value of `5`. Try changing its value to `6`.
  - **Question:** What happens if `mut` is not used?
- Declare a constant named `PI` with the value `3.14159`.
  - **Task:** Try changing its value and observe the error.

---

## 2. Shadowing

- Declare a variable `y` with the value `10`. Then, shadow it by adding `5` to its value. Print the final value of `y`.
- Try changing the type of a variable using shadowing:
  - Example: Shadow a string `"123"` with its parsed integer value.

---

## 3. Data Types

- Create an array of the first 5 prime numbers. Access the third element and print it.
- Define a tuple containing:
  - Your name (string),
  - Your age (integer),
  - Your height (floating-point number).
  - Destructure the tuple to print each value individually.

---

## 4. Functions

- Write a function `add` that takes two integers and returns their sum.
- Create a function `convert_to_celsius` that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the Celsius equivalent.
  - **Formula:** `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9`.

---

## 5. Statements and Expressions

- Assign the result of the expression `3 * (2 + 5)` to a variable `z` and print it.
- Write a function that uses a block expression to calculate the square of a number.

---

## 6. Control Flow

- Write a program that takes a number and prints:
  - `"Positive"` if it’s greater than 0.
  - `"Negative"` if it’s less than 0.
  - `"Zero"` otherwise.
- Modify the program to include an `else if` branch that checks if the number is even or odd.

---

## 7. Loops

- Use a loop to print `"Rust is great!"` 5 times.
- Use a `while` loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate over an array of integers and print their squares.

---

## 8. Advanced Looping

- Create a program that counts down from 10 using a `for` loop and prints `"LIFTOFF!"` at the end.
- Use nested loops to print a multiplication table from 1 to 5.
  - Use **labeled loops** to exit both loops when a product exceeds 12.

---

## Bonus Challenges

1. Write a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius using functions and user input.
2. Create a program to generate the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a `while` loop.
3. Print the lyrics of *"The Twelve Days of Christmas"* song using a `for` loop and arrays for the verses.
